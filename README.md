# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunications company and develop predictive models to identify at-risk customers. The goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn Dataset, containing customer details such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure. The target variable is Churn (Yes/No).

## Project Workflow

**The project follows a structured approach:**

1. Data Preparation

- Handling missing values

- Encoding categorical variables

- Converting data types where necessary

2. Data Splitting

- Dividing data into 80% training and 20% testing

3. Feature Selection

- Identifying key features influencing customer churn

4. Model Selection

- Evaluating multiple classification algorithms

5. Model Training

- Training the best-selected model

6. Model Evaluation

- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
